You’re reading the inaugural edition of the TLA⁺ Foundation monthly development update. Here I’ll summarize the past month of development for the benefit of Foundation patrons and interested members of the community. These posts are authored by Andrew Helwer and while I’ll focus a fair bit on my own work (as a way of providing a monthly status update to the Foundation, really), I will also provide a rundown of other happenings in the community! If I missed your contribution or there was some important part of it I didn’t capture in the summary, worry not! These newsletters will be published monthly so it’s easy to hop on the next train; try opening an issue here.</description></item></channel></rss>
