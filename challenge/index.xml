ü•á First Place ‚Äî Specula (Code ‚Üí Spec) Specula, developed by Qian Cheng, Dr. Tianyin Xu, and Dr. Yu Huang, is an open-source framework that automatically derives TLA+ specifications from source code and checks them against the implementation. It combines an LLM-based generator with a Control Flow Analyzer to ensure syntactic and structural correctness, then uses SandTable for trace validation. Demonstrated on etcd‚Äôs Raft (Go) and Asterinas‚Äôs SpinLock (Rust), Specula offers a reproducible path toward scaling automated specification to broader codebases and abstracting algorithmic intent.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><lastBuildDate/><atom:link href="https://foundation.tlapl.us/challenge/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
