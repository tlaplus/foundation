###### The TLA+ Foundation, in collaboration with [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), is pleased to announce the *GenAI-accelerated TLA+* challenge—an open call for submissions that explore the intersection of TLA+ and generative AI.

###### This initiative aims to foster practical and innovative tooling, workflows, and approaches that bring the capabilities of generative AI and LLMs to TLA+. Participants are invited to develop engineering-oriented solutions that advance the usability, accessibility, and automation of formal specification through the integration of GenAI.

#### **Awards**

* **1st Place**: [Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5090/) (sponsored by NVIDIA)
* **2nd Place**: One-year single seat, individual subscription to [Github Copilot Pro+](https://github.com/github-copilot/pro-plus) (sponsored by the TLA+ Foundation)
* **3rd Place**: One-year single seat, individual subscription to [Github Copilot Pro](https://github.com/github-copilot/pro) (sponsored by the TLA+ Foundation)

#### **Example Project Areas**

Participants may submit work including, but not limited to:

* Intelligent refactoring of TLA+ specifications (e.g., managing `UNCHANGED` correctly when adding variables)
* LLM-enhanced linters, formatters, or other development tools
* LLM-driven tools for automated grading in education
* Visualizations of specifications or execution traces
* Generation of type annotations for tools like Apalache
* Synthesis of inductive invariant candidates, validated via [TLC](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus) or [Apalache](https://github.com/apalache-mc/apalache/)
* Synthesis of [TLAPS](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlapm) proofs
* Synthesis of entire specifications from source code and design documents

#### **Evaluation**

Submissions will be judged by the **TLA+ Specification Language Committee (SLC)**

The Jury will evaluate submissions based on their functionality, relevance to the TLA+ ecosystem, and the thoughtful use of AI. Submissions must be reproducible by the Jury. Passive formats, such as videos alone, are not sufficient. However, the Jury does not require a fully polished product—a prototype is sufficient. All submissions must be released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit), and any underlying AI models must be publicly available.

The use of GenAI/LLMs is explicitly encouraged, provided that any AI-generated content—such as specs, invariants, visualizations, … —is checked using some form of verification such as the TLA+ tools.

#### **Participation Criteria**

Eligible participants must meet the following:

* Prior engagement with the TLA+ community (e.g., contribution to [mailing lists](https://groups.google.com/g/tlaplus), [forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/tlaplus/), [open-source repositories](https://github.com/tlaplus/), [conference presentations](https://conf.tlapl.us/), or [academic publications](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=TLA%2B))
* Must not be a member of the TLA+ Foundation Board or Specification Language Committee
* Must not be subject to any legal, contractual, export control, or jurisdictional restrictions that would preclude participation

#### **Submission Timeline & Announcement**

Submissions will open alongside this announcement. The deadline to submit entries for the challenge is two months from the announcement date on 07/03/2025. Submissions must be sent to genai@tlapl.us. The jury will select the winner one month after the submission period closes. We welcome innovative, technically robust, and practically valuable contributions that explore and expand the potential of GenAI within the context of TLA+. 

For longer-term or foundational engineering and research efforts related to TLA+, we encourage you to explore the [TLA+ grant program](../grants/2024-grant-program/).
